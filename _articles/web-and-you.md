# The Web and You

## Description

In this offline storytelling/discussion activity, learners reflect on and share observations, ideas, and feelings about their own web use, and what the web means to their communities. What do they love or hate about the web? What are they curious about? What kinds of things would they like to do on/with the web? Facilitators use insights from this activity to contextualize the rest of the curriculum for their group of learners. This group activity should also help learners get to know each other and feel connected.

## Opening Circle [6-10 mins]
* The facilitator asks each participant to introduce themselves and answer an icebreaker question (such as favorite food, favorite game, what muppet or cartoon character you most resemble). The icebreaker question helps learners get to know others in the group and feel more comfortable during the discussion; it can-- but does not have to be-- web literacy related. 
'' Tip! The facilitator should model a short introduction, so learners know what this looks like, and especially, how much time they have for their introduction. ''
* Establish ground rules/shared agreements. Explain that participants will be learning together-- sharing perspectives and ideas, working together in small groups or pairs, and as a large group. Each person is encouraged to share actively. 
* Facilitator asks: what can we do to work and learn better together?  Solicit ideas from the group, and make a list of positive behaviors for group work. 
Tip! Facilitator can add important points if the group does not come up with them. These may include…
* Listen actively
* Don’t interrupt 
* Be respectful of other members
* Be open to perspectives that are different from yours
* If you usually talk a lot in groups, try listening more
* If you usually listen, try speaking up and sharing your thoughts

## Introducing the Web [3 to 5 mins]
The facilitator explains that learners will be thinking and talking about the internet and the world wide web-- the tools and technologies we use when we are “online.” 
The facilitator asks the group to share kinds of things they do “online”
Tip! For this round of sharing, the facilitator can encourage learners to raise their hands and wait to be called on to speak, or ask learners to share “popcorn style”-- where they spontaneous call out examples that occur to them. Choose the sharing style that works best for your group.
Tip! If the group doesn’t come up with many examples-- or if the group does not have prior web experience-- facilitator can provide ones that seem appropriate for this group. Examples of online activity might include
sending or receiving email
using the web to connect with distant family members 
using an application on a smart phones-- for example, maps app to help you navigate
using job finder sites
“googling” or searching the web for information
streaming shows or music on sites like Netflix or Spotify
logging into facebook or other social media sites
gaming
shopping
Facilitator points out that there are many different ways to be online, many reasons people use the web. The group will be exploring these together in a storytelling exercise.
