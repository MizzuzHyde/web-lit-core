# The WebLit Core Curriculum README

Project lead and contact: [An-Me](mailto:anme@mozillafoundation.org)

Mozillaâ€™s Core Web Literacy Curriculum consists of Core Activities that provide learners with a basic conceptual understanding of how to read, write, and participate on the web. 

Developing this core curriculum has truly been a community effort involving staff, volunteer contributors, and allied organizations from around the world. A special shout-out to our web literacy leaders and their respective public library staff: Sherry Lehane, Erin Davis Anderson, Joanna Milner, Melanie Wilson, and Matthew Kopel for all their contributions, and to Matt Rogers and Digitalme for making web literacy badges a reality.

We also need your help with the following:
* resolving issues

#### Share your Remixes
For anyone remixing and creating own custom version of the curriculum, we encourage you to add your remixes to https://www.mozillapulse.org/issues/web-literacy.

#### Earning Digital Badges
Digitalme through their Open Badges Academy is offering digital badges for the web literacy skills.  If you are interested in earning or having your learners earn badges, see https://www.openbadgeacademy.com/mozilladirectory.  To help you with assessment of badges, we created these [guidelines](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19QAgcMiVkkAILcT8PZwohrC5A5Y-eUxEw6FUmsp7zRM/edit) to help organizations and programs that are implementing badging systems and systems for assessing their badges.
