# The WebLit Core Curriculum README

Project lead and contact: [An-Me](mailto:anme@mozillafoundation.org)

Mozilla’s Core Web Literacy Curriculum consists of Core Activities that provide learners with a basic conceptual understanding of how to read, write, and participate on the web. Developing this core curriculum has truly been a community effort involving staff, volunteer contributors, and allied organizations from around the world. A special shout-out to our web literacy leaders and their respective public library staff: Sherry Lehane, Erin Davis Anderson, Joanna Milner, Melanie Wilson, and Matthew Kopel for all their contributions, and to Matt Rogers and Digitalme for making web literacy badges a reality. 

#### Facilitator-Friendly Materials
The Core Activities are designed to teach the web in the context of learners’ own needs, interests, and everyday experiences. Brainstorming and sharing, discussion and reflection, and fully participatory, collaborative work are integral to this community-based Web Literacy learning experience. 
 
Each Core Activity is written to support anyone who wants to teach and empower others to use the web. We’ve provided detailed explanation of the concepts, examples and visual aids where possible, as well as activity-specific tips for facilitators on successfully delivering the material to varied audiences. 

There are “Additional Resources” sections in each Core Activity that point you to background materials, further reading, and related activities. We’ve also collected general facilitation tips from our experienced trainers, as well as a guide for reference. And, of course, your feedback and insights on these materials are always welcome—see “How to Help Improve this Project” below.

#### Earning Badges
Digital badges capture the evidence and are the demonstration knowledge and achievement. See here is a link to Digitalme’s open badges academy for anyone interested in earning web literacy digital badges. Mozilla Foundation initially pioneered digital badges, and in 2016 turned over responsibility to IMS Global to continue the evolution of the [open badges technical specification](https://www.imsglobal.org/initiative/enabling-better-digital-credentialing).
