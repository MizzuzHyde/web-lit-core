# The WebLit Core Curriculum README

Project lead and contact: [An-Me](mailto:anme@mozillafoundation.org)

Mozillaâ€™s Core Web Literacy Curriculum consists of Core Activities that provide learners with a basic conceptual understanding of how to read, write, and participate on the web. 

Developing this core curriculum has truly been a community effort involving staff, volunteer contributors, and allied organizations from around the world. A special shout-out to our web literacy leaders and their respective public library staff: Sherry Lehane, Erin Davis Anderson, Joanna Milner, Melanie Wilson, and Matthew Kopel for all their contributions, and to Matt Rogers and Digitalme for making web literacy badges a reality.

#### Share your Remixes
